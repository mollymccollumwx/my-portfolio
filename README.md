# My Portfolio 
This project created a basic portfolio with three pages: About, Contact, and Portfolio. HTML and Bootstrap CSS Framework were used to create a responsive webpage. The requirements for this webpage included:
   
   - A consistent navigation bar with functioning links and responsive design 
   - Responsive images and layout that pass checkpoints at 900px, 768px, and 400px 
   - Semantic HTML
   - Personalized information
   - Proper utilization of Bootstrap and the grid system
   

## Installation

---
The code for this webpage can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mollymccollumwx/my-portfolio). The [deployed website](https://mollymccollumwx.github.io/my-portfolio/) is features a simple yet responsive design. 

## Usage

---
When the webpage is first opened, the user is greeted by an "About Me" introduction:

The user will be able to toggle between pages using the navigation bar in the top right corner of the screen. On the contact page, the user will find a contact form to fill out:
